# VR_Spending_Analysis
This project analyzes online spending ratios across different virtual reality (VR) platform groups using Python.  
It demonstrates practical data analysis steps including data cleaning, type conversion, custom categorization, and statistical summarization.  

The workflow includes:
- Handling missing or invalid data values using median imputation and logical filtering.  
- Categorizing VR platforms into functional groups such as 3D/AR Creation, Enterprise Tools, VR Advertising, and Immersive Experience.  
- Computing key summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean) for online spending ratios.  
- Visualizing results through bar charts with error bars and kernel density plots to compare both inter-group and within-group variations.  

The project highlights the use of core Python data science libraries — **pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** — to transform raw data into interpretable insights on platform engagement and spending behavior.
